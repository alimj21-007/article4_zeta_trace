# Abstract

This paper develops a rigorous framework for **trace formulas** and **spectral counting**
associated with the Riemann zeta function. Building on operator-theoretic constructions,
we establish asymptotic laws for spectral distributions and compare them with the
classical Riemann–von Mangoldt formula.

Numerical experiments are performed using synthetic eigenvalues and the first 100
nontrivial zeta zeros. The analysis includes:

- **Comparison plots** between normalized spectral values $\mu_n$ and zeta zeros $\gamma_n$  
- **Spacing statistics** highlighting similarities in local distribution  
- **Density overlays** showing qualitative agreement between spectral and zeta data  
- **Trace function evaluations** illustrating operator-theoretic identities  

The results support the spectral interpretation of the Riemann zeros and provide
evidence for structural parallels between operator spectra and zeta zero distributions.
This work contributes to ongoing efforts to connect analytic number theory with
spectral analysis and operator theory.
